            Hi! Welcome to Solana.
            This app makes it easier for you to invite your friends to Solana Block chain.
            Go ahead and "Send voucher" to someone with their email address. A voucher is only valid for 5 days.
            Once you have sent the voucher, recipient will get an email with a link.
            Once they have accepted the voucher (in the timeframe) you will receive confirmation with their Solana wallet Public Key. 
            After that you can transfer tokens to them.
        </div>
